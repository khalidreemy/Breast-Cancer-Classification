# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Breast Cancer Mass-Calcification Classification Project

In this project we classifiy breast cancer images as either "mass" or "calcification".
I used transfer learning to build the model.
Dataset is not fully loaded to this repository because of the big size.

This project is an implementation for a research. The accuracy achieved is 95%.
